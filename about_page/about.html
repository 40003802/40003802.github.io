                We are Bean and Brew, a small coffee store chain with multiple stores
                across Yorkshire and Northumberland. <!--History of company etc... Reuses "row", "main" and "side" classes for convenience-->

                Our company began in the late 1970s as a single store based in Harrogate,
                Yorkshire, and we were one of the first companies to use fair-trade coffee
                and all organic milk for our products. Since then, we have expanded our
                business to multiple stores, and have continued to deliver our services
                to the highest standard possible. See our services in the section below.
